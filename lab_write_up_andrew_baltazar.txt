Lab Experience Write Up

Hi professor, as you can probably already tell from our presentation and repository,
we don't have much and didn't come close to finishing. We did start working on it a little
late but still with enough time to finish. Unfortunately though, our group did struggle with 
implementing the peer to peer network and understanding the concepts behind it. Personally
I spent longer than I expected trying to understand how the chord algorithm works and how
it could be implemented. I did manage to get a better understanding of the concepts needed but
not enough to be successful in implementing it and ultimately I didn't contribute much at all to
the project. Unfortunately there is a larger reason for why I hardly contributed which is that a 
family member ended up in the hospital a few weeks ago and the majority of my time and energy 
was spent dealing with that and the various issues that have risen as a result of that over the last few weeks.
Frankly, the last thing on my mind has been this project and the class. Fortunately my group has been very 
understanding even though I didn't get into specifics with them. If you would like to grade me
separately from them then that is fair. All in all, I definitely wish I could have put more time
and effort into the project not only for my group and for my grade but because it is a really
cool assignment that I think I could have benefitted from completing.
