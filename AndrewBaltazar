Lab Experience Write Up

Our group was not able to successfully complete the assignment. We did start working on it a little
late but we did think that we had more than enough time to finish. Unfortunately though, our group did struggle with 
implementing the peer to peer network and understanding the concepts behind it. We did
attempt to try and procedurally implement each part of the project to make it easier and allow
us to better understand the fundamental concepts. We began by simply trying to understand 
the chord algorithm and figure out how to go about implementing it. However, trying to understand how 
to implement the concepts turned out to be more difficult than we anticipated even with the information
we had gathered from outside sources and from the class. Personally I spent longer than expected trying
to understand how the chord algorithm works and how it could be implemented. I did manage to get a better understanding of the concepts needed but
not enough to be successful in implementing it and ultimately I didn't contribute much at all to
the project. Unfortunately there is a larger reason for why I hardly contributed which is that a 
family member ended up in the hospital a few weeks ago and the majority of my time and energy 
was spent dealing with that and the various issues that have risen as a result of that over the last few weeks.
Frankly, the last thing on my mind has been this project and the class. Fortunately my group has been very 
understanding even though I didn't get into specifics with them. If you would like to grade me
separately from them then that is fair. All in all, I definitely wish I could have put more time
and effort into the project not only for my group and for my grade but because it is a really
cool assignment that I think I could have benefitted from completing.
