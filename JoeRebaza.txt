Lab Experience

My experience writing up the code in this lab required a lot of additional research that I didn't expect.
I'm not well experienced when it comes to coding for networking purposes, so this was a total shock because I
struggled with finding the write libraries/tools to do what I needed the code to do. There was a log of debugging
involved (expected) and a lot of reference searching in order to understand what everything does/should do. My group-mates
were a lot of help during this lab processes as they helped me get on a clear path on what to focus on on this lab.
Unfortunately we couldn't finish the whole thing but we did get a lot done and it was a learning experience all together.
If there was more time I think we could've made this a lot better/cleaner that had all the required features and maybe even more.
It was also a good learning experience working with Python as I'm not entirely comfortable with the language because of the
simplistic syntax and wide range of libraries. It was difficult trying to find the write one for the job so I ended up
using a good variety for the different jobs the code was required to do. I know some libraries that was used could've done
most of the work that is required but I figured using different libraries would help me understand the different approaches for
the same execution/result.
